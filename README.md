## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains **no source code**—it serves solely as a demonstration resource for the **BeyondLife** prototype hosted via Expo.

🔍 **BeyondLife** is designed for research and concept exploration. It is **not intended for production use** or the management of sensitive personal data. Evaluate and enjoy this app as a prototype, not as a finalized product.

❗️ **Demo Version Details**:

The current demo version is a **simplified version** of the full application. It currently supports setting up a digital will for **X (formerly Twitter)**, while support for **Gmail** and **Google Drive** will be included in the full version.  

To ensure **data security for demo users** (e.g., avoiding accidental deletion of personal tweets), the demo allows users to link their private Twitter accounts but does **not use the authorized token** to retrieve or modify any data. Instead, predefined **sample tweets** are provided for testing purposes.

However, the **cloud storage link is fully functional** in this demo version. During interactions, **BeyondLife** will upload encrypted data to the demo user’s cloud storage.
